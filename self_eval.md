# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code? 
It's useful to use a conditional when working with multiple variables and outcomes because we can specify different results.
1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?
I keep using `=` where I should be using `==` and forgetting `end` at the end of my statements. I would take time to slow down and get these things right the first time around.
1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?
It's satisfying to write slightly more complex code and have it print the desired results! I look forward to writing things that are more and more complex in the future. It's satisfying because it's a very clear indication that I'm learning the content.
